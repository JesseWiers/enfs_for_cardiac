# ENFs for Cardiac MRI — Codebase

This repository contains the core scripts used in the MIDL 2026 submission paper **"Geometry-Aware Cardiac MRI Representation Learning with Equivariant Neural Fields."**

Current runnable scripts:

- `train_2d_reconstructer.py` — Train ENF/CNF models for 2D CMR reconstruction  
- `create_latent_dataset.py` — Extract ENF latent point clouds or CNF global latents  
- `endpoint_classification.py` — Train downstream classifiers for clinical endpoints  

This codebase accompanies the experiments and results presented in the manuscript.
